# ConvertingLidarToGeoTiff
Just a small project that has scripts that are used to convert, georeference, and color some lidar data and turn into a geotif. 

The data used by this project comes from the demo data from the company Rigel.

Specifically, it is the demo data for the VUX-1:

This would have been easier with the LasTools:

But I didn't want to pay the money for it since it was a one time only thing. 

Hopefully these scripts can help someone else who is trying to do the same thing.
